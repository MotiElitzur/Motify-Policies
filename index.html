        <h1>Privacy Policy for Motify</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Motify! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Motify ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use our mobile application, Motify (the "App").</p>
        <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>A Clear Note on Location vs. Proximity</strong></p>
            <p>To provide our service, we need to know when other users are near you. However, it is essential to understand how we achieve this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We DO NOT use or collect your device's GPS location.</strong> We do not track your movements, know your physical address, or store a history of where you have been.</li>
                <li><strong>We use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for Proximity Detection.</strong> The App uses your device's Bluetooth signal to detect the presence of other users nearby. Think of it like a digital "shout" that can only be "heard" by other devices running the App within a short range (e.g., in the same room or area). We record that an interaction occurred, but not <em>where</em> it occurred.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why does the Google Play Store mention 'Approximate Location'?</strong><br>
            Google Play requires apps that use Bluetooth to scan for other devices to declare that they use "Approximate Location." This is because this technology can be used to infer that you are in the same general area as another user. We want to be transparent: our use is strictly for real-time proximity detection, not for mapping or tracking your location over time.</p>
        </div>
