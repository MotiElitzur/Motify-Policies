        <h1>Privacy Policy for Motify</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 26, 2023</p>

        <p>Welcome to Motify! Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Motify ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use our mobile application, Motify (the "App").</p>
        <p>By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>A Clear Note on Proximity Data</strong></p>
            <p>Our service connects you with nearby users by using your device's Bluetooth signal. We want to be clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>We do not use or request GPS location data.</strong> Our functionality is based on short-range Bluetooth proximity only.</li>
                <li>To be compliant with app store policies, we declare the collection of "Approximate Location." This is because using Bluetooth to detect nearby devices is categorized as a form of approximate location by platform operators. Our use is strictly for discovering other users in your immediate vicinity, not for tracking your physical location history.</li>
            </ul>
